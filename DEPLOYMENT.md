git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/houndslight/Kyoku.git
git push -u origin main
```

2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Click "Add New Project"
4. Import your GitHub repository
5. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js settings
6. Click "Deploy"

### Option 2: Deploy via Vercel CLI

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

## 🔧 Vercel Configuration

No additional configuration needed! The project uses:
- **Framework Preset**: Next.js
- **Build Command**: `pnpm build` (auto-detected)
- **Output Directory**: `.next` (auto-detected)
- **Install Command**: `pnpm install` (auto-detected)

### Optional: Custom Domain

After deployment, you can add a custom domain in Vercel:
1. Go to Project Settings → Domains
2. Add your domain
3. Configure DNS records as instructed

## 📱 PWA Configuration

The app includes PWA support via `manifest.json`. After deployment:
- Users can install it as an app on desktop/mobile
- Works offline with cached assets
- App icons are configured (you'll need to add actual icon files)

### Required Icons

Create and add these files to `/public`:
- `icon-192.png` (192x192px)
- `icon-512.png` (512x512px)

## 🌐 Post-Deployment

After deployment, update the download button URL in `app/page.tsx`:
- Current: `https://github.com/houndslight/Kyoku`
- Update to your actual GitHub repository URL

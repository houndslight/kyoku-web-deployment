# Icons Needed for PWA

To complete the PWA setup, you need to create and add these icon files:

## Required Files

1. **icon-192.png** (192x192 pixels)
   - Used for Android home screen
   - Should be a square icon with your app logo

2. **icon-512.png** (512x512 pixels)
   - Used for splash screens and larger displays
   - Should be a square icon with your app logo

## Design Guidelines

- Use a simple, recognizable icon
- Ensure good contrast for both light and dark backgrounds
- Consider using the Japanese character æ›² (Kyoku) as the icon
- Maintain consistent branding with the app's minimalist aesthetic

## Tools to Create Icons

- **Figma** - Design your icon
- **Canva** - Quick icon creation
- **GIMP/Photoshop** - Professional editing
- **Online Icon Generators** - Quick PWA icon generation

## Quick Solution

You can use a favicon generator service:
1. Create a single 512x512 icon
2. Use a PWA icon generator to create all sizes
3. Replace the files in this directory

**Note**: The app will work without these icons, but PWA installation will use default browser icons.
